        { id: 'sus-2', question: 'What do shock absorbers do?', answer: 'Shock absorbers dampen spring oscillations to control vehicle bounce and maintain tire contact with the road.' },
        { id: 'sus-3', question: 'What is the difference between shocks and struts?', answer: 'Struts are structural components that support vehicle weight, while shocks only dampen movement but don\'t bear weight.' },
        { id: 'sus-4', question: 'What are control arms?', answer: 'Control arms connect the suspension to the vehicle frame, allowing wheels to move up and down while controlling alignment.' },
        { id: 'sus-5', question: 'What is wheel alignment?', answer: 'Wheel alignment adjusts suspension angles to ensure tires make proper contact with the road and wear evenly.' },
        { id: 'sus-6', question: 'What causes uneven tire wear?', answer: 'Uneven tire wear can result from poor alignment, under/over inflation, worn suspension components, or improper balancing.' },
    ],
    steering: [
        { id: 'str-1', question: 'What is power steering?', answer: 'Power steering uses hydraulic or electric assistance to reduce the effort needed to turn the steering wheel.' },
